To quote Pinheiro and Bates (2000), 
"New corStruct classes, representing user-defined correlation structures, 
can be added to the set of standard classes and used with the modeling 
functions in the nlme library. For this, one must specify a constructor 
function, generally with the same name as the class, and, at a minimum, 
methods for the functions coef, corMatrix, and initialize."

Description of Classes

Standard classes of correlation structures (corStruct) available in the nlme library.

Value/Available standard classes:

corAR1	
autoregressive process of order 1.

corARMA	
autoregressive moving average process, with arbitrary orders for the autoregressive and moving average components.

corCAR1	
continuous autoregressive process (AR(1) process for a continuous time covariate).

corCompSymm	
compound symmetry structure corresponding to a constant correlation.

corExp	
exponential spatial correlation.

corGaus	
Gaussian spatial correlation.

corLin	
linear spatial correlation.

corRatio	
Rational quadratics spatial correlation.

corSpher	
spherical spatial correlation.

corSymm	
general correlation matrix, with no additional structure.
