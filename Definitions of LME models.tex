\section{Definition of LME Models}
%-------------------------------------------------------%
In matrix notation a linear model can be represented as
\[ \hat{y}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \dots + \epsilson_i\]


\[ y = \boldsymbol{X} \boldsymbol{\beta}  + \epsilon\,\]

%-------------------------------------------------------%

In matrix notation an LME model can be represented as
\[ y = X \beta + Zu + \epsilon\,\]
where
\begin{itemize}
\item y is a vector of observations, with mean $E(y)=X\beta$
\item $\beta$ is a vector of fixed effects
\item \boldsymbol{u} is a vector of random effects with mean $E(u)=0$ and variance-covariance matrix 
$\operatorname{var}(u)=G$.
\item \epsilon is a vector of IID random error terms with mean $E(\epsilon)=0$ and variance 
$\operatorname{var}(\epsilon)=R$
\item X and Z are matrices of regressors relating the observations y to $\beta$ and u, respectively.
\end{itemize}
